Congrats on solving the first level of this task! You were able to figure out the ASCII text from the image, but wait! Your journey is not yet over. After the end of the text yo
u will find a (200, 150, 3) coloured image. This image is a part of the bigger image called "zucky_elon.png". Find the top left coordinate (Image convention) from where this ima
ge was taken. The x coordinate represents the colour of a monochrome maze hidden in an image with coloured noise. Find the maze and solve the maze using any algothrim like dfs b
ut better. Try comparing them and seeing how they perform like A*, RRT, RRT* for example. Once the maze is solved you will see a word. This word is a password to a password prot
ected zip file which contains a png. Note that the password is case sensitive and all the aplhabets in the password will be capital letters This is your treasure. To open the tr
easure you need to convert the image in to an audio file in a simple way like you did for this ASCII text. Once converted, open the .mp3 file and enjoy your treasure, you deserv
ed it! A part of the image "zucky_elon.png" will begin immediatly after the colon, image-lv2
