There are two files namely `ArkOptimisation.cpp` which is original file provided in problem statement (Refer to task1.pdf for more information about the task) and `T1.cpp` which is the solution file for this task.

* Use Powershell to run your commands
* Put the given `timeit.txt` file given in any directory (except your project directory)
* Rename it to  `timeit.bat`
* Add its file location to the system PATH variable
* Run this command after building:
`timeit <<exe file name>> -f input.txt`
