# Task 4: Tracking Multiple Objects

## Format

The ` T4.py` file is the solution file to this task (only part 1 done). `KalmanEqn.py` file contains the Kalman Equations in the form of functions. The **Data files** directory id to contain the raw data given (csv files which were given, refer to `task4.pdf` for more information) and **Output** folder is to contain the output images of trajectory generated at different stages (5 per CSV). The estimated locations of other ground stations (calculated with respect to first ground station) are to be stored in the txt files in **Output** directory. 

## Running the script

```bash
python T4.py
```
### Execution of each iteration generates a plot for the user to look and writes the results in respective folders
